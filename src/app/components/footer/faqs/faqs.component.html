    <h2>What if I want to cancel my order?</h2>
    <p class="m-6 text-gray-500">
      As long as the restaurant has not yet started preparing your order, you're
      able to cancel your order in order help. If the restaurant has already
      started preparing your order and you want to cancel, please get in touch
      with us, you can do this in order help as well.

    <h2>What if my order is late?</h2>
    <p class="m-6 text-gray-500">
      Sometimes things outside of a riderâ€™s control can cause a delay. Where we
      can, we will always try and proactively call you if we become aware that
      your order might not arrive within the estimated time of delivery, and our
      team will work to get your order to you as quickly as possible.

    <h2>What if I have allergies?</h2>
    <p class="m-6 text-gray-500">
      If you have specific allergies and are concerned about any items on a
      menu, please check the restaurant notes section of the restaurant menu and
      for further information contact the restaurant directly prior to ordering.
      Increasing numbers of Partner Restaurants will be displaying dish by dish
      allergens information. Where that information is not available or if you
      have further questions, please contact the restaurant prior to ordering if
      you have an allergy.
